# Hi there, I'm Your Akhil👋

I'm a passionate developer and data scientist with a focus on **AI**, **Machine Learning**, and **Computer Vision** ans **Semiconductor Technology** . Have Fun reading some of my key projects I've worked on and my areas of expertise .

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. **[Color Quantizer using PyTorch 🎨](https://github.com/YourUsername/ColorQuantizer)**
   - A neural network-based color quantizer that reduces the number of colors in images for various applications like compression and artistic effects.
   - Uses **K-Means clustering** for color palette reduction and **MSE loss** for optimization.
   - Implements a **PyTorch** model for efficient training and inference.

### 2. **[Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) - Reinforcement Learning 🧠](https://github.com/YourUsername/PPO-Implementation)**
   - Implements the **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** algorithm using **TensorFlow** and **NumPy** for reinforcement learning.
   - Focuses on policy optimization and dynamic action selection in uncertain environments.

### 3. **[AI-based Wafer Defect Detection 🔬](https://github.com/YourUsername/Wafer-Defect-Detection)**
   - A machine learning model that detects defects in semiconductor wafer images using convolutional neural networks (**CNNs**).
   - Employed for quality control in semiconductor manufacturing, reducing the need for manual inspection.
